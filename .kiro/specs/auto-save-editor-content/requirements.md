# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the Mermaid editor with automatic temporary storage to prevent data loss, improved UI/UX with better editor layout, and enhanced file management capabilities. The system will automatically save editor content to browser storage, provide a full-screen editor experience, and offer proper file save/update functionality instead of just downloads.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user creating Mermaid diagrams, I want my editor content to be automatically preserved across browser refreshes, so that I don't lose my work if I accidentally refresh the page or close the browser tab.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user types in the editor THEN the system SHALL automatically save the content to browser storage after a brief delay
2. WHEN the component loads THEN the system SHALL automatically restore any previously saved content from browser storage
3. WHEN no previous content exists THEN the system SHALL load the default diagram content
4. WHEN the auto-save occurs THEN the system SHALL NOT interrupt the user's typing experience

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user working on complex diagrams, I want the auto-save to be efficient and non-intrusive, so that my editing experience remains smooth and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is actively typing THEN the system SHALL debounce the auto-save to avoid excessive storage operations
2. WHEN the auto-save is triggered THEN the system SHALL complete the operation without blocking the UI
3. WHEN the storage operation fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully without crashing
4. WHEN the user stops typing THEN the system SHALL save the content within 2 seconds

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user switching between different diagram projects, I want the auto-save to work independently of the existing manual save/load functionality, so that I can still use both features as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN auto-save is active THEN the existing manual save functionality SHALL continue to work unchanged
2. WHEN auto-save is active THEN the existing manual load functionality SHALL continue to work unchanged
3. WHEN the user manually loads a saved diagram THEN the auto-save SHALL update to track the newly loaded content
4. WHEN the user manually saves a diagram THEN the auto-save storage SHALL also be updated to match

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user working with the editor interface, I want the editor to occupy the full left portion of the screen and provide proper text editing capabilities, so that I have maximum space and functionality for writing and editing my Mermaid diagrams.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component loads THEN the editor SHALL occupy the entire height of the left pane
2. WHEN the split pane is resized THEN the editor SHALL maintain full coverage of its allocated space
3. WHEN viewing on different screen sizes THEN the editor SHALL remain fully visible and usable
4. WHEN the editor has focus THEN it SHALL provide optimal text editing experience with proper sizing
5. WHEN I press the Tab key in the editor THEN it SHALL insert a tab character instead of moving focus away
6. WHEN I use Tab for indentation THEN the editor SHALL properly format the Mermaid diagram code
7. WHEN I press Shift+Tab THEN the editor SHALL reduce indentation appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user managing diagram files, I want proper file save and update functionality instead of just downloads, so that I can maintain and update my existing files without creating duplicates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I load a file THEN the system SHALL remember the file reference for future saves
2. WHEN I make changes to a loaded file THEN I SHALL have the option to update the original file
3. WHEN I want to save as a new file THEN I SHALL have the option to create a new file
4. WHEN I save changes to an existing file THEN the system SHALL update the file instead of downloading a new copy
5. WHEN no file is currently loaded THEN the save operation SHALL create a new file
6. WHEN I choose "Save As" THEN the system SHALL allow me to specify a new filename and location
7. WHEN I make changes to a loaded file THEN the system SHALL mark the file as edited with a visual indicator
8. WHEN I save the changes THEN the edited indicator SHALL be cleared
9. WHEN I load a new file THEN any previous edited state SHALL be cleared
10. WHEN I press Ctrl+S (or Cmd+S on Mac) THEN the system SHALL save the current file
11. WHEN I use the keyboard shortcut to save THEN the system SHALL follow the same save logic as the manual save button

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user concerned about browser storage limits, I want the auto-save feature to manage storage efficiently, so that it doesn't consume excessive browser storage space.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing auto-save data THEN the system SHALL use a separate storage key from manual saves
2. WHEN the component unmounts THEN the system SHALL clean up any timers or listeners
3. WHEN storage quota is exceeded THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and continue functioning
4. WHEN the auto-save data becomes stale THEN the system SHALL have a mechanism to identify and handle old data
