# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Transform the existing "Code To Diagram" application into "SO Assistant" - a comprehensive project management system that allows users to manage multiple projects with requirements, diagrams, teams, tasks, and notes. The system will provide a landing page for project selection and creation, followed by a dedicated project workspace with navigation between different project aspects.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a landing page with my existing projects and create new projects, so that I can organize my work into separate project contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a landing page with a list of existing projects
2. WHEN displaying projects THEN each project SHALL show its title and description
3. WHEN the landing page loads THEN the system SHALL provide a section for creating new projects inline (not in a dialog)
4. WHEN creating a new project THEN the system SHALL require a project title and description
5. WHEN a project is created successfully THEN the system SHALL navigate to the project workspace page
6. WHEN a user selects an existing project THEN the system SHALL navigate to that project's workspace page

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate between different aspects of my project (Requirements, Diagrams, Teams, Tasks, Notes), so that I can manage all project components in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN entering a project workspace THEN the system SHALL display a navigation menu with options: Requirements, Diagrams, Teams, Tasks, Notes
2. WHEN the project workspace loads THEN the system SHALL be divided into two sections: navigation bar and main content area
3. WHEN a navigation option is selected THEN the system SHALL display the corresponding component in the main content area
4. WHEN switching between navigation options THEN the system SHALL maintain the current project context
5. WHEN the Diagrams option is selected THEN the system SHALL display the diagram workspace functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload files to generate requirements automatically, so that I can quickly establish project requirements from existing documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Requirements section is selected THEN the system SHALL display a file upload area
2. WHEN files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL send the files to the backend for processing
3. WHEN the backend processes files THEN the system SHALL return a requirements list
4. WHEN requirements are returned THEN the system SHALL display them in an editable list format
5. WHEN requirements are displayed THEN the user SHALL be able to modify, add, or remove individual requirements
6. WHEN requirements are modified THEN the system SHALL save the changes to the project

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application branding to reflect "SO Assistant" instead of "Code To Diagram", so that the application identity matches its expanded functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN all references to "Code To Diagram" SHALL be replaced with "SO Assistant"
2. WHEN displaying the application title THEN it SHALL show "SO Assistant"
3. WHEN showing navigation or UI elements THEN they SHALL use "SO Assistant" branding consistently
4. WHEN displaying help text or descriptions THEN they SHALL reference "SO Assistant" functionality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access diagram functionality similar to the current ProjectWorkspace, so that I can continue creating diagrams within the new project structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Diagrams navigation option is selected THEN the system SHALL display diagram creation and editing functionality
2. WHEN in the Diagrams section THEN the system SHALL provide the same diagram editing capabilities as the current ProjectWorkspace
3. WHEN creating diagrams THEN they SHALL be associated with the current project context
4. WHEN switching away from Diagrams THEN the system SHALL preserve any unsaved diagram work
5. WHEN returning to Diagrams THEN the system SHALL restore the previous diagram state

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want placeholder sections for Teams, Tasks, and Notes, so that the navigation structure is complete and ready for future development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Teams navigation option is selected THEN the system SHALL display a placeholder component indicating "Teams functionality coming soon"
2. WHEN the Tasks navigation option is selected THEN the system SHALL display a placeholder component indicating "Tasks functionality coming soon"
3. WHEN the Notes navigation option is selected THEN the system SHALL display a placeholder component indicating "Notes functionality coming soon"
4. WHEN displaying placeholder components THEN they SHALL maintain consistent styling with the rest of the application
5. WHEN placeholder components are shown THEN they SHALL include the project context (project name/title)
