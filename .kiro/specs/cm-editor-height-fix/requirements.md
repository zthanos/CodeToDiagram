# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues in the current diagram management system by implementing proper backend integration, fixing type safety problems, improving user feedback, and establishing a robust diagram creation and saving workflow. The system will provide a seamless user experience with proper error handling, loading states, and backend synchronization.

## Requirements

**User Story:** As a user creating and managing diagrams, I want all diagram operations to be properly integrated with the backend API, so that my data is reliably stored and synchronized across all operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a new diagram THEN the system SHALL immediately call `ProjectApiService.addDiagram()` with proper project association
2. WHEN I save diagram content THEN the system SHALL call a backend update endpoint to persist changes
3. WHEN I load a diagram THEN the system SHALL fetch current content from the backend API
4. WHEN backend operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry mechanisms
5. WHEN I perform any diagram operation THEN the local state SHALL remain synchronized with backend data

### Requirement 2: Type Safety and Data Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer working with the codebase, I want all type mismatches and data inconsistencies to be resolved, so that the application is reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working with diagram IDs THEN the system SHALL use consistent types (number vs string) across all components
2. WHEN mapping API responses THEN the system SHALL properly convert backend data to frontend models
3. WHEN handling null values THEN the system SHALL have proper null checks and default values
4. WHEN importing types THEN there SHALL be no duplicate or conflicting type definitions
5. WHEN TypeScript compilation occurs THEN there SHALL be no type errors or warnings

### Requirement 3: Comprehensive User Feedback System

**User Story:** As a user performing diagram operations, I want clear visual feedback about the status of my actions, so that I understand what's happening and can respond appropriately to any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I perform any operation THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators
2. WHEN operations succeed THEN the system SHALL display success notifications with clear messaging
3. WHEN operations fail THEN the system SHALL show user-friendly error messages with suggested actions
4. WHEN I'm saving content THEN the system SHALL show save status indicators in the UI
5. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear offline/connectivity status

### Requirement 4: Robust Diagram Creation Workflow

**User Story:** As a user creating new diagrams, I want a streamlined creation process that immediately persists to the backend and allows me to start working without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click "Create Diagram" THEN the system SHALL immediately create a diagram in the backend with a temporary title
2. WHEN a diagram is created THEN it SHALL open in a new tab and be ready for immediate editing
3. WHEN I first save the diagram THEN the system SHALL prompt for a proper name and update the backend
4. WHEN creation fails THEN the system SHALL show clear error messages and not create incomplete local state
5. WHEN I start typing THEN the content SHALL be auto-saved to the backend with proper debouncing

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Save Dialog and Workflow

**User Story:** As a user saving diagrams, I want a clear and reliable save process with proper validation and error handling, so that I never lose my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I save a new diagram THEN the system SHALL show a naming dialog with input validation
2. WHEN I save an existing diagram THEN the system SHALL update the content without showing the naming dialog
3. WHEN save operations are in progress THEN the system SHALL show loading states and disable conflicting actions
4. WHEN save operations fail THEN the system SHALL show specific error messages and retry options
5. WHEN I provide invalid input THEN the system SHALL show real-time validation feedback

### Requirement 6: Improved API Service Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the backend, I want a robust API service layer with proper error handling and response mapping, so that all backend operations are reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL have proper request/response validation
2. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL categorize errors and provide appropriate user messaging
3. WHEN network issues happen THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
4. WHEN mapping API responses THEN the system SHALL consistently transform data to frontend models
5. WHEN handling timeouts THEN the system SHALL provide reasonable timeout values and error recovery

### Requirement 7: Enhanced Editor Integration

**User Story:** As a user editing diagrams, I want the editor to be properly integrated with the save workflow and provide clear status indicators, so that I always know the state of my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I'm editing a diagram THEN the editor SHALL show the current save status (saved/modified/saving)
2. WHEN I trigger save operations THEN the editor SHALL properly emit save events with current content
3. WHEN auto-save occurs THEN the editor SHALL provide visual feedback without interrupting my work
4. WHEN I switch between tabs THEN each editor SHALL maintain its own save state independently
5. WHEN save operations complete THEN the editor SHALL update its status indicators accordingly

### Requirement 8: Optimistic Updates and State Management

**User Story:** As a user performing operations, I want the interface to respond immediately while operations complete in the background, so that the application feels fast and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I perform operations THEN the UI SHALL update immediately with optimistic changes
2. WHEN backend operations fail THEN the system SHALL rollback optimistic changes and show error messages
3. WHEN multiple operations are in progress THEN the system SHALL manage state conflicts appropriately
4. WHEN I switch between diagrams THEN each SHALL maintain its own state independently
5. WHEN synchronization issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide conflict resolution options

### Requirement 9: Comprehensive Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user encountering errors, I want clear information about what went wrong and what I can do to resolve the issue, so that I can continue working effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL distinguish between different types of connectivity issues
2. WHEN validation errors happen THEN the system SHALL show specific field-level error messages
3. WHEN server errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly explanations and suggested actions
4. WHEN operations can be retried THEN the system SHALL provide retry buttons with appropriate logic
5. WHEN errors are unrecoverable THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on next steps

### Requirement 10: Loading States and Progress Indicators

**User Story:** As a user waiting for operations to complete, I want clear visual indicators of progress and system status, so that I understand what's happening and how long it might take.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN operations are in progress THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading spinners or progress bars
2. WHEN multiple operations are queued THEN the system SHALL indicate the overall progress status
3. WHEN operations take longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide additional context or options
4. WHEN I can cancel operations THEN the system SHALL provide cancel buttons with proper cleanup
5. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition from loading to completed states

### Requirement 11: Input Validation and Data Integrity

**User Story:** As a user entering data, I want real-time validation and clear feedback about data requirements, so that I can provide correct information efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enter diagram names THEN the system SHALL validate characters, length, and uniqueness in real-time
2. WHEN I provide invalid input THEN the system SHALL show specific validation messages immediately
3. WHEN I submit forms THEN the system SHALL prevent submission of invalid data
